How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

A comprehensive approach is essential for ensuring the functionality and security of code. As the Contact and ContactService classes demonstrate, 
a code structure with clear classes and methods contributes to readability, maintainability, and extensibility. Data integrity is ensured and vulnerabilities, 
such as input validation errors, are mitigated by incorporating validation logic within these classes. Unit tests, such as those found in the ContactServiceTest and ContactTest classes,
allow systematic validation of the functionality of code, catching errors early in development. In addition to this, implementing security best practices, 
including input validation, parameter sanitization, and error handling, strengthen the software's security posture, preventing exploitation and protecting user information.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

A software product that resonates with its target audience requires an understanding of user needs. 
An approach based on user-centric design helps developers better understand user preferences and pain points. 
This approach is reflected in the Contact and ContactService classes, which encapsulate essential contact information and provide methods for managing contacts.
Moreover, iteration based on user feedback, such as direct engagement and usage analytics, enables continuous improvement. 
Software developers can ensure its relevance and value to users by actively listening to feedback and adapting it accordingly.


How do I approach designing software?

Designing software requires a holistic approach that prioritizes modularity, testing, and security.
Breaking down functionality into modular components, as demonstrated in the Contact and ContactService classes, promotes code reusability,
maintainability, and scalability. Additionally, emphasizing test-driven development (TDD) and comprehensive testing methodologies ensures that the software behaves as intended and remains resilient to errors and edge cases.
Integrating security measures from the outset, such as input validation and access controls, fosters a proactive approach to security, 
minimizing vulnerabilities and mitigating risks throughout the software development lifecycle. 
By embracing these principles, developers can create software that not only meets user needs but also delivers a seamless and secure user experience.
